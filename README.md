Vending Machine written in c++


Creating a small vending machine in c++ language
First making it to appear on my command prompt window and once I have everything working and going I will make it into a
full UI appliction with buttons and noises and everything, it will be awesome!!!

Do not know what else to say.... I have two dogs.
This is my first time actually using GitHub after years of messing around and just lurking.

Will promise that after this is done more awesome projects will come.
